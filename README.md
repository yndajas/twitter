# @yndajas Twitter archive

This is an archive of my original tweets from @yndajas (now deactivated) and my own replies to those tweets.

## Credits

- [@dariusk](https://github.com/dariusk) for building the [Twitter archiver guide and tool](https://tinysubversions.com/twitter-archive/make-your-own) that made this relatively easy to start
- [@elduvelle](https://github.com/elduvelle) for documenting [GitHub Pages compatibility and setup steps](https://github.com/elduvelle/elduvelle.github.io)

## Licence

There's no licence file in here, but feel free to reuse parts of this codebase outside the data export (which is in the `yndajas` subdirectory at the time of writing) without credit, as though under a MIT licence, as per [@dariusk](https://github.com/dariusk)'s tool (see the credits section). Data from the export can be reproduced, but with explicit attribution for clarity.
